This is supposed to send an email from a varied email adress to another varied adress but this time
there is a verification system for it. A verification code is sent to a referee email adress which should be acessible by
the user, But the first input email can be either acessible or not .
For instance if the user has no referee email adress, they cannot use this system because there's need to secure the use of other people's email adresses as well as prevent unintentional enmity .
REMEMBER: THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS IS FOR EMERGENCY EMAIL CONTACT FROM YOURS TO ANOTHER PERSON'S EMAIL ADRESS. Maybe a 
loved one or a business partner.    
A confirmation message from the developer is sent to notify the sender.
    upcoming extra security features:

    (I)  An email sent to the sender email to confirm if the use of it is right.
        How it works -> 
        two buttons are in the body of the email , confirm and decline .. 
        decline will bring about error and warning messages on the UI
        Ignoring and accepting will activate the mail code on the server
        I considered ignoring in case the sender really doesnt have any acess to the email adress at all.
                
    (II) AI program to check for insults, to ensure no disrespect.
                
                
                
                
                Any illegal use will result in calling of relevant authorities
                
         -------The security system is to ensure that this is used for the right reasons only------ .
